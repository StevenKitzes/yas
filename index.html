      <h2>Yet Another Stack</h2>
      <p class="reality">In case it's not obvious, yes, this is a satirical stack, randomly generated.</p>
      <p class="reality">How often do you hear about new technologies in development or out for release?  How often do you hear about new stacks being composed, either of new technologies, or new permutations of existing tech?  Can you relate to the memes about new languages or frameworks coming out every week, so fast that you can't keep up?</p>
      <p class="reality">How often do these new stacks change your life?  How often does a new framework move the needle on your developer experience?  How often do you find a new piece of tech that, after investing time learning it, even makes it into your regular rotation, let alone your professional or passion projects?</p>
      <p class="reality">Simplicity and efficiency are not borne of learning new languages, stacks, frameworks, and platforms every month.  Simplicity and efficiency are not the result of cramming more libraries into your org, alongside the tech you've already tried before.  This behavior and its results are the opposites of simplicity and efficiency.  In fact, we've already got terms to substitute here: churn, burnout, and debt.</p>
      <p class="reality">Next month, instead of learning a new language, library, framework, platform, or stack, just for that one month, put that effort into considering all of the tools you've already got under your belt.  Not just the tools, but how you can use them.  Is there anything a new piece of tech can do, that you can't already do?  Could you use your time better by building something or solving problems with tools you've already invested in?  What's more valuable: keeping up with an endless stream of new tech whose only purpose is to keep us learning new tech, or delivering?</p>
      <p class="reality">I'm not advocating against learning.  We all had to learn to get where we are.  And we will only grow by learning more.  But how mindful are we of what we are learning, and why?  What's the value of the things we are learning?  Be conscious of how you invest your time, lest you waste your time on YAS: Yet Another Stack.</p>
